# Uterine Fibroid (Leiomyoma)

## Definition
A benign tumor of the smooth muscle fibers of the myometrium.

## Incidence
Occurs in 25% of women in the child-bearing period.

## Etiology
Associated with increased Estrogen (E2). Risk factors include Genetic predisposition, Race, Nulligravida, and Anovulation.

## Clinical Picture
Can be asymptomatic. The most common symptom is Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB / Menorrhagia). Other symptoms can include pain, a palpable mass, and infertility.

## Diagnosis
Ultrasound (Transvaginal or Transabdominal) is the gold standard for diagnosis. Hysteroscopy or Laparoscopy can also be used.

## Treatment
- **Asymptomatic:** Generally require no treatment unless large (>14 wks size) or causing infertility.
- **Medical:** Options target bleeding (e.g., Tranexamic acid) or hormonal control (e.g., GnRH agonists).
- **Surgical:** Definitive treatment includes Myomectomy (removal of the fibroid) or Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus).
