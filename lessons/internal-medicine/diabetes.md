# Diabetes Mellitus

## Definition
A chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.

## Classification
- Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (autoimmune destruction of beta cells)
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (insulin resistance + relative insulin deficiency)
- Gestational Diabetes
- Secondary Diabetes (due to other causes like Cushing’s syndrome, drugs, etc.)

## Clinical Features
- Polyuria (excess urination)
- Polydipsia (excess thirst)
- Polyphagia (excess hunger)
- Weight loss (especially in Type 1)
- Fatigue and recurrent infections

## Diagnosis
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL
- HbA1c ≥ 6.5%
- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (OGTT)
- Random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms

## Management
- **Lifestyle:** Diet control, regular exercise, weight reduction.
- **Drugs:**
  - Metformin (first-line for Type 2)
  - Insulin (essential in Type 1, sometimes in Type 2)
  - Other agents: SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas.
- **Monitoring:** HbA1c every 3–6 months, complications screening.

## Complications
- Acute: DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state).
- Chronic: Retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease.
